    "\n",
    "The input variable will be \"GEO_province\" and the output variable will be \"WELLNESS_primary_healthcare_provider\" as both variables quantify the research question together. Visuals include Contingency Tables and Stacked Bar Charts. Stacked Bar Charts would visualize the proportion of \"Yes\" and \"No\" outputs for each Canadian province. Contingency Tables would visualize relationships between each categorical inputs and each categorical outputs. \n",

    "We will conduct bootstrap sampling to obtain 95% confidence interval. The Fisher's Exact Test on the Contingency Tables will be completed with an alpha significance level of 0.05% to obtain statistical significance. Assumptions include Independent samples, honest self-reporting, random sampling, proportional sampling for each Canadian province.\n",

    "#### Variables & Visuals\n",
    "The input variable will be \"DEMO_relationship_status_dating\" and \"DEMO_relationship_status_single\" respectively while the output variable will be \"WELLNESS_life_satisfaction\". This is based upon wanting to compare the life satisfaction output between the inputs of relationship status (single & dating). The visual will include a graph that displays a Violin Plot for each qualitative input category. This is because the quantitative output and its distribution can be more informative of the distribution and spread of the data.  \n",
